## Facial Mesh & Emotion Recognition
This project showcases the power of computer vision and deep learning by combining real-time facial mesh detection and emotion recognition. Using MediaPipe, the facial mesh module captures and visualizes over 400 detailed facial landmarks from webcam input, providing a precise map of facial geometry. This allows for applications such as facial tracking, expression analysis, and augmented reality overlays. Alongside this, the emotion recognition module uses DeepFace, a deep learning-based framework, to analyze live video frames and determine the dominant emotion on the face, such as happiness, sadness, or surprise.

Both modules operate independently, enabling users to explore facial structure and emotional states in real time. The project requires only a webcam and standard Python libraries, making it accessible for developers, researchers, or hobbyists interested in AI-driven facial analysis. Whether you want to build interactive applications, mood-aware systems, or simply learn more about facial recognition technology, this repository offers a solid foundation to start with.
